## Pong Game
This repository includes a simple Pong implementation using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

### Running
1. Install dependencies (requires Python 3):
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 pong.py
   ```

Use the `W`/`S` keys for the left paddle and the `Up`/`Down` arrows for the right paddle.

**Note:** The game must be run in an environment with a graphical display. Running in a headless terminal without an X server will cause initialization errors.
